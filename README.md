A portfolio of my technical writing samples

## About Me
I am Janhavi Kulkarni, a tech enthusiast with a back-ground in programming and consultancy.

I was always excited about writing as a hobby, but never realised that my skills in tech industy can by combined with my hobby of writing.
That's what led me to technical writing.

This repo is a collection of my writing samples that are both my platform for practice and showcase of my skills as I learn and progess in this field.

Feedback is essential for understanding oneâ€™s progress in any field, but only constructive feedback truly supports growth.

Happy reading!ðŸ“–ðŸ˜Š
